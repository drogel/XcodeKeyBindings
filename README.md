# XcodeKeyBindings

My Xcode KeyBindings configuration.

## How to import the snippets to your Xcode

Run the installation script and then restart Xcode:
```
$ source install.sh
```

**About this script:** Xcode key bindings configuration file is written in a `.idekeybindings` file in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/KeyBindings/`. Under the surface, `.idekeybindings` files are just `.plist` files that contain all the information about the key mappings. You can just copy your key bindings configuration files into this folder, restart Xcode and you should have all of them ready to use. That's all the installation script does.
